# FlagGame

FlagGame is a simple web-based game that tests your knowledge of national flags. In each round,
a flag is displayed and the player has to guess which country it belongs to.
The game offers different levels of difficulty and provides hints and correct answers for each question.


## Usage
To start playing the game, simply open the project in your web browser. You will be presented with a series of multiple-choice questions, each showing a flag image and four possible answers. Click on the answer you think is correct, and the game will tell you whether you got it right or wrong, as well as your current score.

The game will continue until you answer all questions or decide to quit by clicking on the "Quit" button.

## Requirements
FlagGame requires a modern web browser that supports Vue.js.
